# Antistasi PLUS on Chernarus with Star Wars and WW2 Factions

Title says it all, this is a modification of the Chernarus Antistasi PLUS mission, with a couple factions added:

# How to add factions
- add rebel, invader, and occupier templates to \Templates\NewTemplates
- add init parameters in \functions\init\initParams.sqf and \MissionDescription\params.hpp
- add mod detection in \Templates\detector.sqf
- make it so it chooses the right faction with \Templates\selector.sqf
- there might be more we have to do, this is all I know so far

## Star Wars - Empire Era

### Empire [Opposition mod]
- Tie fighters, storm troopers, ATST's the whole Galactic Empire shebang
### Criminals [Opposition mod]
- Sail barges, Jaba the Hutt, bandits, and Mandalorians

## Star Wars - Clone Wars Era

### Republic [3AS and Opposition mods]
- Clones, galactic marines, AT-TE's
### Separatists [3AS and Opposition mods]
